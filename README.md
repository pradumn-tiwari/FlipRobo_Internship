ðŸš€ FlipRobo Technologies â€“ Data Science Internship (Sept 2023 â€“ Mar 2024)
This repository contains key work and learning highlights from my Data Science Internship at FlipRobo Technologies. During this 6-month virtual internship, I worked on real-world projects involving web scraping, data extraction, preprocessing, and collaboration on ML models.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Languages: Python, SQL

Libraries & Tools: requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, MySQL, Pandas, NumPy

Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Git

ðŸ“Œ Key Contributions
Web Scraping Automation
Built efficient scraping pipelines using Python (requests, Scrapy, and Selenium) to collect structured data from multiple dynamic web sources, improving data access speed by 35% for internal teams.

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Applied Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess scraped datasets â€” including handling missing values, normalizing formats, and feature engineering â€” to prepare data for analysis and modeling.

Feature Engineering & EDA
Engineered custom features and conducted exploratory data analysis to support model-building decisions using techniques such as correlation mapping, value distribution checks, and trend spotting.

Collaboration in Model Building
Contributed to team discussions and code reviews on supervised ML strategies, helping refine model input features and testing pipelines.

ðŸ“ˆ What I Learned
Practical implementation of web scraping best practices, handling dynamic sites and request limitations.

Real-time collaboration on data pipelines and machine learning workflows.

Strengthened skills in SQL integration with Python for seamless data retrieval and storage.
